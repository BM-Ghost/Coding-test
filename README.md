**Development Environment Setup:**

1. **Install Visual Studio Code:** Install Visual Studio Code from the official website.

2. **Install C/C++ Extension:** Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. Search for "C/C++" and install the official Microsoft C/C++ extension.

3. **Install GCC Compiler:** You'll need the GCC compiler to compile your C code.

**Compiling and Running the Source Code:**

1. **Create a New Folder:** Create a new folder on your computer to organize your project. This is where you'll save your source code file and any related files.

2. **Create Source Code File:** Open Visual Studio Code, go to File > New File, and write source code into the new file. Save the file with a `.c` extension, for example, `main.c`.

3. **Configure Terminal in VS Code:** In Visual Studio Code, go to View > Terminal to open an integrated terminal within the IDE. This terminal will be used to compile and run your code.

4. **Compile the Code:** In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved your source code file. Use the GCC compiler to compile the code:
   ```
   gcc -o coding-test main.c
   ```
5. **Run the Program:** Once the code is compiled successfully, you can run the executable by entering its name in the terminal:
   ```
   ./coding-test
   ```
   This will execute your program and show the output on the terminal.

6. **View Output:** You should see the output of your program in the terminal, similar to the sample output you provided.
